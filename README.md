# Posterr
## Poster manager for plex / emby / jellyfin

### Introduction
This application manages posters from a poster directory, (re)placing posters in corresponding media directory. The purpose of this application is to speed up poster management, renaming, etc. Very useful to also re-add posters when Radarr or Sonarr removes them.

Currently, the script is still in development, and only movie poster management is working.

In the future, I'm planning on making a chrome extension for use with a webserver, that will allow for easily adding posters from [ThePosterDB]("https://theposterdb.com").
